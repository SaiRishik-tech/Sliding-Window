so after struggling with differrent sliding window problems with different varities i got fed up and didnt code .
then every problem i faced i could tell that its bruteforce and optimal i wasnt sure i implemented correctly and i didnt .
i kept on solving 
saw the soltuions understood how did they appraoch tried replicating their thinking exactly . practiced the code . understood it line by line everytime i faield to write a correct code .

unitil i cam e across this problem 
Count Number of Nice Subarrays
which invovled previous concept knowlege and i exactly could code .  built my confidence . although not 100% but yeah i finally came across writing a ssolution. 
so teh magic works as you keep on doing and understanding.

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int maxlen=0;
        int left=0;
        int oddcount=0;
        vector<int>currArr;

        for(int right=0;right<nums.size();right++)
        {
            currArr.push_back(nums[right]);
            if(nums[right]%2!=0)
            {
                oddcount++;
            }
            if(oddcount==k)
            {
                int currlen=right-left+1;
                maxlen=max(currlen,maxlen);
            }
            else if (oddcount>k)
            {
               currArr.erase(currArr.begin());
                left++;

            }
        }
        return maxlen;
        
    }
};


this is what i could code . although dfailed two test casess . but gave me confidence.
so now i dry run and know the exact error


class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int maxcount=0;
        int left=0;
        int oddcount=0;
        vector<int>currArr;

        for(int right=0;right<nums.size();right++)
        {
            currArr.push_back(nums[right]);
            if(nums[right]%2!=0)
            {
                oddcount++;
            }
            if(oddcount==k)
            {
               maxcount++;

            }
            else if (oddcount>k)
            {
               currArr.erase(currArr.begin());
                
                if (currArr[left] % 2 !=0)
                {
                    oddcount--;
                }
                left++;

            }
        }
        return maxcount;
        
    }
};

but there are some issues as well]


seems we have to use an unordered map or prefix sum is optimal to check how many times a given odd occuured

Here's the clear breakdown (rephrased in simpler terms):
cpp
Copy
Edit
unordered_map<int, int> countMap;
countMap[0] = 1;   // Base case: 0 odd numbers seen once
int odd = 0;       // Running count of odd numbers
int result = 0;    // Final answer
üö∂ Step-by-Step:
cpp
Copy
Edit
for (int num : nums) {
    if (num % 2 != 0) odd++;  // Increment odd count if current num is odd
‚ùì Why check countMap[odd - k]?
Let‚Äôs say odd = 5, and we want subarrays with exactly 3 odd numbers.

Then odd - k = 2.

If we‚Äôve seen odd = 2 happen 2 times before, then there are 2 subarrays that end at the current index and have exactly 3 odds.

cpp
Copy
Edit
    if (countMap.find(odd - k) != countMap.end()) {
        result += countMap[odd - k];  // Add how many such subarrays exist
    }
üìå Finally:
cpp
Copy
Edit
    countMap[odd]++;  // Record current odd count for future use
}
üîö Final return:
cpp
Copy
Edit
return result;  // Total number of nice subarrays with exactly k odd numbers
üß† So what is countMap[odd]++ doing?
It‚Äôs saying: "Hey, I‚Äôve now seen this odd count one more time." So it will help for the future values when we check odd - k.

‚úÖ In Short:
You understood it 90% right, just needed clarification on:

Why countMap[odd - k] gives the number of subarrays

Why we do countMap[odd]++ ‚Äî to prepare for the next iterations

Let me know if you want a dry run example with values.
